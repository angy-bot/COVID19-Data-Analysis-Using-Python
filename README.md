# COVID19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python

A complete set of course materials is owned by Coursera. In addition, John Hopkins University has released the COVID19 dataset. My trials can only be shown by the answers.

# Course Objectives:

Using both datasets together, analyze whether there is a connection between the spread of the virus in a country and the happiness of its citizens. I would like to thank the instructor of the course: Ahmad Varasteh.
